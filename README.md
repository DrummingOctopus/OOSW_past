Object Oriented Software Development past projects - IT Helpdesk

This repository is for a past project (2022) from a software development course where I was asked to build an IT Helpdesk software solution using classes (objects), data structures (including singly-linked lists) amnd generates a basic database. All syntax is done in Python. A more detailed description of the software can be found in the "Documentation" pdf file.

This content will not be updated or changed anytime soon.
